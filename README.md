# STM32
Here are some notes and codes in the process of learning STM32.



Each chapter of STM32 is stored in a folder whose name starts with a number. In these folders:

- Notes are available as markdwom documents.

    The images in the notes are saved in a folder named media.

- The code folder is used to store the code that implements the learning content.

- In most cases the notes and code are based on the STM32F103C8T6, programmed with the HAL library.
